            <h1>1. End Customer License Agreement</h1><br><br>
            <p>This End Customer License Agreement (“License Agreement”) was executed, signed and took effect on Customer’s execution (“Effective Date”) by and between Najam Tech AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 530 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10036 (“Najam Tech AI”) and Customer identified in the Statement of Work (“Customer”).</p>
            <p>Customer and The Brave Next shall be hereinafter individually referred to as “Party” and collectively as “Parties”.</p>
            <p>If the Customer acquires Services (as defined below) under the terms specified herein through a Partner (as defined below), this License Agreement will take precedence over any conflicting terms in the agreement between the Customer and the Partner, insofar as the relationship between the Customer and The Brave Next is concerned. Rights granted to the Customer in a separate agreement with the Partner, which are absent in this License Agreement, are applicable exclusively in the context of that Partner. Consequently, the Customer is obliged to pursue any remedies or enforcement of such rights solely with the Partner and not Najam Tech AI.</p>
            <p>BY SIGNING A STATEMENT OF WORK, ACCESSING, RECEIVING, AND/OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. IN NO EVENT MAY YOU ACCESS, RECEIVE OR OTHERWISE USE ANY  The Brave Next PRODUCT OR SERVICE WITHOUT AGREEING TO THESE TERMS (OR ANOTHER AGREEMENT AGREED TO IN WRITING BY NAJAM TECH AI).</p>

            <p>4. <span>  “Customer Data”</span> refers to any data or images submitted, uploaded, imported, integrated, or otherwise communicated by Customer to Najam Tech AI.</p>
            <p>5. <span>  “Facility”</span> means the sites/facilities/plants of the Customer in which Services are to be used by Customer.</p>

            <p>7. <span> “License Agreement”</span>  refers collectively to this End Customer License Agreement and any attachments hereto.</p>

            <p>13. <span> “Subscription” </span>refers to a non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable right to use the Services and the output of the Services in accordance with this License Agreement and the Statement of Work (SOW) within the Customer’s relevant facilities, as detailed in the SOW. </p>
            <p>14. <span> “Subscription Start Date”</span>  refers to the date on which the Services commence, as specified in the relevant Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
            <p>15. <span>  “Subscription Term”</span> refers to the initial term during which the Services can be used in a Facility, as outlined in this License Agreement and specified in the relevant Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

Customer’s Confidential Information shall not include Feedback, to the extent that such Feedback relates exclusively to Najam Tech AI’s products or services. “Feedback” means any feedback (e.g., questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas), regarding the Service Software, Services or any other Najam Tech AI product or service that Customer provides to The Brave Next.</p><br><br>
